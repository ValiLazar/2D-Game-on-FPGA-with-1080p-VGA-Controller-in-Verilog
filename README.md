2D Game on FPGA with 1080p VGA Controller in Verilog

üìù General Description

This project is a Verilog implementation of a simple 2D game designed to run on an FPGA development board (specifically, the Digilent Basys 3). The project generates a VGA video signal with a resolution of 1920x1080 (1080p).

The game involves controlling a red triangle (the player) on the screen, with the goal of avoiding horizontally moving blue obstacles. Upon collision detection, the game resets to its initial state.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Hardware

A Digilent Basys 3 development board

A monitor with a VGA input

A VGA cable

Software

Xilinx Vivado Design Suite: The project uses a constraints file (.xdc) specific to this software.

üìÅ Project Structure

The project consists of the following Verilog modules and a constraints file:

1. vga_top.v
   
This is the top-level module that integrates all other components of the system.

Instantiates a clocking wrapper (design_1_wrapper) to generate the required frequency for the VGA signal.

Instantiates the VGA timing controller (vga_1920X1080).

Instantiates the game logic module (vga_deplasare).

Connects the inputs (clock, reset, buttons) and outputs (VGA RGB, Hsync, Vsync signals) to the external pins of the FPGA.

2. vga_1920X1080.v

This module is responsible for generating the VGA timing signals according to the 1920x1080 @ 60Hz standard.

Uses horizontal (h_counter) and vertical (v_counter) counters to track the current position of the electron beam on the screen.

Generates the h_sync and v_sync synchronization signals.

Produces a display_surface signal that indicates the visible area of the screen.

3. vga_deplasare.v

This module contains the core game logic.

Object Rendering: Draws a red triangle (the player) and blue obstacles on the screen.

User Control: Takes input from the btnU, btnD, btnL, and btnR buttons to move the triangle.

Obstacle Movement: Implements the logic for the automatic horizontal movement of the obstacles.

Collision Detection: Checks for an overlap between the coordinates of the triangle and the obstacles. On collision, it resets the position of the player and the obstacles.

4. Basys3_Master.xdc

This is the constraints file that maps the ports defined in vga_top.v to the physical pins of the Basys 3 board.
